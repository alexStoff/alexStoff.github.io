**Radar Integration on an Unmanned Arial System (Current)**
======
### Technical Lead
Working as part of a five-person design team to develop a framework for integrating SIMRAD Halo 20+ marine radar on a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS).
* Working closely with our sponsors at the MITRE Low-Cost Unmanned Swarming Technology (LOCUST) team to assess the feasibility of using commercial marine radar as a low-cost option for local observation capability.
* As technical lead, defined goals specific to the technical implementation of the radar and drone systems.

**Graphic Equalizer & Class D amplifier**
======
Worked in a team to design and develop an audio system with a graphic equalizer and class D amplifier using active filtering, op-amps, MOSFET transistors, and Arduino input.
*	Extensively researched and implemented active filtering, amplification circuits, and PWM signal generation and processing.
*	Drafted and designed a complex circuit using SPICE simulation software.
*	Built the circuit in hardware and extensively tested the real-world function of the system.
* Final Project report: [report](files/IDP Final Report.pdf)

**Digital Systems Computer Design Project**
======
Designed and wrote a 16-bit processor in the Verilog HDL.
*	Heavily used Verilog, Quartus Prime, and ModelSim.
*	Designed an arithmetic logic unit, memory structure, and data path using transistors, gates, and larger architecture units.
*	Created instruction set and ran programs in machine and assembly code on the simulated processor.

**Robot Using Ultrasonic Distance Sensing and Machine Learning**
======
Built and programmed a robot equipped with a rotating ultrasonic distance sensor to map surroundings and interpret results with simple machine learning.
* Worked with a Raspberry Pie operating system to run code in Python.
*	Experience working with Arduino to run various sensors and actuators and relay their outputs to the Raspberry Pie.
*	Used k-means clustering to group data points to identify discrete objects in the robot's field of view.

**Quadcopter movement programming software**
======
Worked in a team of 4 to write a program that parsed human-readable instructions into instructions to be sent to a quadcopter drone.
* wrote instruction parser program
* Debugged drone movement and connection errors
