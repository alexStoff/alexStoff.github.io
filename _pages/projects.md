**Radar Integration on an Unmanned Arial System (Current)**
Technical Lead
======
Working as part of a five-person design team to develop a framework for integrating SIMRAD Halo 20+ marine radar on a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS).
* Working closely with our sponsors at the MITRE Low-Cost Unmanned Swarming Technology (LOCUST) team.
* Defining goals specific to the technical implementation of the system.

**Graphic Equalizer & Class D amplifier**
======
Worked in a team to design and develop an audio system with a graphic equalizer and class D amplifier using active filtering, op-amps, MOSFET transistors, and Arduino input.
*	Extensively researched and implemented active filtering, amplification circuits, and PWM signal generation and processing.
*	Drafted and designed a complex circuit using SPICE simulation software.
*	Built the circuit in hardware and extensively tested the real-world function of the system.
* Final Project report: [report]()
